# Prefix Subscriptions

This example shows how clients can subscribe to all topics with a given prefix at once.

E.g. a client doing a _prefix subscribe_ to `http://example.com/event#` will receive events published to any of `http://example.com/event#foo`, `http://example.com/event#bar`, and so on.
